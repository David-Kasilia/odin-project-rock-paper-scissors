        <p>According To <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors">Wikipedia;</a><br>Rock Paper Scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone")<br> is a hand game, usually played between
            two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.<br> These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended,
            forming a V). <br>"Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
